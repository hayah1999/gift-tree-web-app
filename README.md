# Gift Tree

This is my graduation project, we were a team of 4. My main role was the front-end developer. 98% of the images used in the application are ours. I have received an A grade for it :D. The idea behind the web application is that

- Gift tree is a webapplication that helps you buy an electronic gift card from the brands available and send
  it to your friend, relative, or even a colleague it will be sent to them through e-mail, where they
  can use the gift card to buy what they really need and like from the brand you chose, it helps you
  send a gift from your home hustle free, safe during a pandemic like COVID-19 and without
  imposing your style on them by letting them choose their own gift.
